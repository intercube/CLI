	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	syncCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&syncType, "type", "", "Either 'database' or 'files'")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	syncCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
